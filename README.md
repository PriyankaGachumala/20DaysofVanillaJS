# 20DaysofVanillaJS
To get high level overview, I have taken up a challenge to develop applications without using any fancy JS frameworks, CSS frameworks.

Text Editor: Visual Studio Code

Extensions used in Visual Studio Code:
Live Server,
Prettier,
Bracket Pair Colorizer,
Auto Rename Tag,
JavaScript ES6 code snippets,
Emment- Emment is inbuilt in VS code but we have to add some settings to settings.json file.


Day 1: I have created and validated a form with User defined functions. A small introductory project to get started. [Form Validation](validations-form.netlify.app)

Day 2: Created an Online Movie Seat Booking application. Mainly worked on how to manipulate DOM. Used local storage to save movie name and selected seats by the user, so that on page reload the data will be retained. [Movie ticket booking ap](movieticketbooking-app.netlify.app/)
